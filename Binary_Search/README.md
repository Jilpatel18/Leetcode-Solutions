# Binary Search

This folder contains LeetCode problems that are solved using **Binary Search** or **Binary Search on Answer** techniques.

Binary Search is not limited to searching in a sorted array. Many problems use binary search on the **range of possible answers** by checking feasibility with a greedy or validation function.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Search on sorted data or monotonic conditions
- Binary Search on Answer
- Lower bound and upper bound techniques
- Feasibility checking using greedy logic

## 🧠 Common Patterns
- Answer lies between a minimum and maximum range
- If a condition is true for `mid`, it remains true for all values on one side
- Use a helper check to validate `mid`

## 📌 Typical Problems Include
- Splitting arrays to minimize/maximize a value
- Finding minimum or maximum feasible answer
- Searching in rotated or special arrays
- Optimization problems with constraints

## 🧪 Time Complexity
- Usually **O(log n)** for pure binary search
- **O(n log n)** when combined with validation loops

## 📂 Example Problems
- LeetCode 410 – Split Array Largest Sum
- 
Each solution file follows a **standard GitHub-friendly format** with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Clean and optimized Python code
