# Hash Map

This folder contains LeetCode problems that are solved using **hash maps (dictionaries)** to achieve efficient lookups and frequency counting.

Hash maps allow us to trade space for time, helping reduce brute-force solutions into optimal ones.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Key–value storage
- Constant-time average lookups
- Frequency counting
- Mapping values to indices or states

## 🧠 Common Patterns
- Count occurrences of elements or characters
- Track seen elements to avoid duplicates
- Store indices for fast access
- Combine hash maps with sorting or heaps

## 📌 Typical Problems Include
- Frequency-based problems
- Duplicate detection
- Anagram and string counting problems
- Top-K element problems

## 🧪 Time Complexity
- Usually **O(n)** for traversal and lookup
- **O(n log n)** when combined with sorting

## 📂 Example Problems
- LeetCode 1 – Two Sum
- LeetCode 242 – Valid Anagram
- LeetCode 692 – Top K Frequent Words
- LeetCode 3541 – Find Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant

Each solution file follows a **standard GitHub-friendly format** with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Clean and optimized Python code
