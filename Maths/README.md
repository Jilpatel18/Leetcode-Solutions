# Math

This folder contains LeetCode problems that are solved using **mathematical reasoning and number properties**.

These problems focus on simplifying logic using formulas, arithmetic rules, or number theory instead of relying heavily on data structures.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Number properties (even/odd, divisibility)
- Bit manipulation (math-driven)
- Modular arithmetic

## 🧠 Common Patterns
- Reduce loops using mathematical formulas
- Use properties of numbers to optimize solutions
- Convert problem statements into equations

## 📌 Typical Problems Include
- Finding multiples or divisibility conditions
- Sum and difference problems
- Bitwise math problems
- Mathematical edge cases

## 🧪 Time Complexity
- Usually **O(1)** or **O(log n)**

## 📂 Example Problems
- LeetCode 9 – Palindrome Number 

Each solution file follows a **standard GitHub-friendly format** with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Clean and optimized Python code
