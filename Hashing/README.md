# Hash Map

This folder contains LeetCode problems that are solved using **hash maps (dictionaries)** for efficient lookups and frequency counting.

Hash maps help reduce time complexity by trading space for faster access.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Key-value storage
- Frequency counting
- Fast lookups
- Avoiding nested loops

## 🧠 Common Patterns
- Count occurrences of elements
- Store indices or states
- Track seen elements
- Use hash maps to optimize brute force solutions

## 📌 Typical Problems Include
- Frequency-based problems
- Duplicate detection
- Mapping values to indices
- Character counting in strings

## 🧪 Time Complexity
- Usually **O(n)**

## 📂 Example Problems
- LeetCode 3541 – Find Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant

Each solution file follows a **standard GitHub-friendly format** with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Clean and optimized Python code
