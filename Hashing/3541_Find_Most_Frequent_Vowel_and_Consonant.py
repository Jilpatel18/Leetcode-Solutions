# Problem: 3541. Find Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant
# Approach:
# 1) Use dictionary to count frequency of each character.
# 2) Find the max frequency among vowels (a,e,i,o,u).
# 3) Find the max frequency among consonants.
# 4) Return maxVowel + maxConsonant.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)  (because only 26 lowercase letters)

class Solution:
    def maxFreqSum(self, s: str) -> int:
        freq = {}

        for ch in s:
            freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1

        vowels = "aeiou"
        max_vowel = 0
        max_consonant = 0

        for ch, count in freq.items():
            if ch in vowels:
                max_vowel = max(max_vowel, count)
            else:
                max_consonant = max(max_consonant, count)

        return max_vowel + max_consonant
