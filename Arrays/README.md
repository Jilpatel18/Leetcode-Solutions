# Array

This folder contains LeetCode problems that are solved using **array traversal and manipulation techniques**.

Array problems form the foundation of many advanced problem-solving patterns such as sliding window, two pointers, and prefix sums.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Array traversal
- In-place modification
- Prefix sums
- Index-based access

## 🧠 Common Patterns
- Single pass traversal
- Maintaining running values (sum, count, max, min)
- Using auxiliary arrays when needed

## 📌 Typical Problems Include
- Product and sum based problems
- Subarray problems
- Array transformations
- Greedy array problems

## 🧪 Time Complexity
- Usually **O(n)**

## 📂 Example Problems
- LeetCode 3000 – Maximum Area of Longest Diagonal Rectangle

Each solution file follows a **standard GitHub-friendly format** with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Clean and optimized Python code
