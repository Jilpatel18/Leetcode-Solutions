# Tree

This folder contains LeetCode problems that are solved using **tree traversal techniques** on **binary trees and general trees**.

Tree problems focus on traversing nodes in different orders and applying DFS or BFS to compute results based on parent-child relationships.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- Binary Tree structure
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Recursive and iterative traversal
- Stack and queue usage

## 🧠 Common Patterns
- Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversal
- Level-order traversal
- Root-to-leaf path processing
- Passing values while traversing the tree

## 📌 Typical Problems Include
- Path sum and root-to-leaf problems
- Tree traversal and aggregation
- Height, depth, and diameter calculations
- Tree validation problems

## 🧪 Time Complexity
- Usually **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes

## 📂 Example Problems
- LeetCode 129 – Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
- LeetCode 104 – Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- LeetCode 112 – Path Sum
- LeetCode 102 – Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Each solution file follows a **standard GitHub-friendly format** with:
- Clear approach
- Time and space complexity
- Clean and optimized Python code
